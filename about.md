# About Me

<div class="about-content">
  <p>I am a passionate Machine Learning Software Engineer at Rocket Software with extensive professional research experience in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego. As a dedicated team member with strong interpersonal skills and Agile experience, I specialize in Reinforcement Learning, Motion Profiling, Generative AI, and predictive data analytics. I'm a published problem-solver actively seeking opportunities to advance the field of Deep RL.</p>

  <p>My work bridges the gap between academic research and industrial applications, focusing on developing innovative machine learning solutions that address real-world challenges. From designing novel LLM Citation Generators using multi-gaussian clustering algorithms to implementing reinforcement learning for robotic systems, I bring both theoretical depth and practical implementation skills to complex technical projects.</p>

  <p>With a strong background in both research and industry, I've contributed to cutting-edge projects in rat-robot interactions, neural signaling analysis, and large-scale data science education. My experience spans from leading technical teams to mentoring students, always with a focus on translating complex technical concepts into actionable results.</p>
