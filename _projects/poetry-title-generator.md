# Poetry Title Generator

## Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative writing by developing a sophisticated poetry title generation system. Using advanced natural language processing techniques, the system creates contextually appropriate and artistically compelling titles for poetic works.

## Technical Implementation

The system leverages machine learning algorithms trained on a comprehensive dataset of poetry titles and content to understand the nuanced relationship between poetic themes and effective titling strategies.

## Key Features

- Intelligent analysis of poetic content and themes
- Context-aware title generation algorithms  
- User-friendly interface for interactive experience
- Customizable output based on poetry style and genre

## Educational Context

Developed as part of LIGN 167 coursework, this project demonstrates practical applications of computational linguistics in creative domains while exploring the technical challenges of generating meaningful artistic content through algorithmic approaches.
