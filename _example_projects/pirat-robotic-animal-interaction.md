# PiRat: Robotic Animal Interaction Using Bayesian Inference

## Project Overview

As Technical Lead for the Robotics Using Bayesian Inference (RUBI) project in the Chiba Neuroscience Lab at UCSD's Cognitive Science Department, I spearheaded the development of an autonomous robotic system designed to study pro-social behaviors in animals through intelligent robot-animal interactions.

## Technical Implementation

### Core System Architecture

The project centers around a small ROS-powered differential-drive robot equipped with sophisticated machine learning capabilities. The system uses real-time pose-estimation data to enable autonomous exploration and intelligent agent interaction through reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Algorithm Development Journey

Over the course of two years, I implemented and tested a progressive series of self-learning techniques:

1. **Basic Probability Models**: Started with low-powered discretized positional state spaces
2. **Markov Chains**: Advanced to more sophisticated probabilistic modeling  
3. **Bayesian Models**: Implemented Bayesian inference for improved decision-making
4. **Proximal Policy Optimization**: Currently testing advanced PPO algorithms for optimal performance

Each algorithm utilizes positional data as state-space input and velocity commands as action-space output, enabling the robot to learn and adapt its interaction strategies in real-time.

### Software Engineering Excellence

**Programming Environment**: Developed primarily in Python using in-house ROS-command software, leveraging NumPy and PyTorch for core computations.

**Development Methodology**: Followed industry-standard practices including:
- Agile development calendar
- Git version control and Jira project management
- Comprehensive unit testing framework
- Thorough literature review for each implementation phase

**Performance Optimization**: Completely refactored the in-house Kinect-based pose-estimation software in C++, rebuilding depth algorithms from scratch to achieve over 300% performance improvement and significantly reduced latency.

## Key Innovations

### Real-Time Pose Estimation
- Adapted and optimized Kinect-based tracking for live positional data collection
- Implemented adaptive algorithms that adjust to experiment parameters
- Developed comprehensive data logging and video recording capabilities

### Statistical Validation Framework
- Created end-to-end testing pipeline using Jupyter Notebook
- Implemented ML statistical testing using Scikit-learn for algorithm comparison
- Designed accuracy and efficiency measurement systems for the entire software stack

### Multi-Modal Data Integration
- Built systems for simultaneous tracking of multiple agents
- Integrated visual object representation with real-time data streams
- Developed robust data collection pipeline for behavioral analysis

## Research Impact

This project represents a significant advancement in understanding animal-robot interactions and has implications for:
- Behavioral neuroscience research methodology
- Autonomous robotics in biological settings  
- Machine learning applications in animal behavior studies
- Development of socially-aware robotic systems

## Technical Leadership

As the primary software engineer, I regularly communicated progress across multiple technical levels, from detailed syntactical implementations to high-level strategic objectives. The project's continued success under my technical guidance demonstrates the effectiveness of combining rigorous engineering practices with innovative research methodologies.

## Future Applications

The expertise gained from this multi-disciplinary project directly translates to various software engineering and machine learning applications, particularly in:
- Autonomous systems development
- Real-time computer vision applications
- Reinforcement learning implementations
- Multi-agent system design
- Robotics and human-computer interaction
