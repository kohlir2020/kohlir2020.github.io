# Using Simulated Information Limitation to Perpetuate Self-Regulation as a Tool for Balancing Exploration-Exploitation in Bio-Influenced Learning Tasks

## Project Status
**First Author - In Preparation**

## Abstract

This research explores a novel approach to enhancing artificial learning systems by implementing simulated information limitations that mirror biological constraints. The work investigates how these constraints can foster self-regulatory behaviors that naturally balance exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of known successful strategies.

## Research Motivation

Biological systems have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for managing the exploration-exploitation dilemma under natural information limitations. This research seeks to understand and replicate these mechanisms in artificial learning environments to improve adaptive behavior and learning efficiency.

## Methodology

The study employs computational models that simulate information scarcity conditions, allowing artificial agents to develop self-regulatory strategies that emerge naturally from environmental constraints rather than being explicitly programmed.

## Expected Contributions

- Novel framework for bio-inspired artificial learning systems
- Improved understanding of self-regulation in constrained information environments  
- Practical applications for autonomous systems requiring adaptive exploration strategies
- Theoretical insights into the role of information limitation in cognitive development

## Current Status

This work is currently in the research and development phase, with preliminary results showing promising outcomes for improved learning efficiency and adaptive behavior in artificial agents.
