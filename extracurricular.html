  <h3>UC San Diego Data Science Teaching Assistant</h3>
  <p>
    I was an instructional assistant for UCSD's COGS 108 - Data Science in Practice course for 3 quarters.
    During my last quarter as an IA, I delivered a weekly discussion section lecture series that covered course material and interactively guided students through hands-on learning homeworks. My lectures are available via UCSD Podcast here: https://podcast.ucsd.edu/watch/fa23/cogs108_a05
